    <h1>Winnie The Pooh Tuxedo</h1>

   <p>“Tuxedo Winnie the Pooh” also known as " A Fellow Man of Culture", this meme has circulated around the internet for the better part of at least six years. It started as a reaction image on 4chan, and eventually gained mainstream notoriety in 2019 on Reddit. It features an altered image of Winnie the Pooh reclining in an armchair in his finest evening wear.
    
        
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>At the time, the unedited image of Pooh falling asleep in a chair was already being used as a reaction meme to express boredom or apathy. The anonymous user added a tuxedo and gave Pooh a more devilish expression that was used to convey smugness.
        </p>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>The original image first appeared in a Disney featurette in 1974, titled Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too. During a meeting at Rabbit's house Poo can be seen repeatedly dozing off, making it very apparent that he either doesn't get the point of the meeting or that he is genuinely disinterested in the topics being discussed.
          The animation was re-released in 1977 as part of a full length film that garnered more attention for the cartoon and undoubtedly, the scene.
